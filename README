NAME
    Digest::Guava - Perl XS interface to the Google's Guava consistent
    hashing algorithm

SYNOPSIS
      use Digest::Gauva qw(guava_hash);
      guava_hash($integer_key, $buckets_count);

    OR

      use Digest::Gauva;
      Digest::Gauva::guava_hash($integer_key, $buckets_count);

DESCRIPTION
    Google's Guava hashing algorithm.

    Assign to input a "bucket" in the range [0, buckets), in a uniform
    manner that minimizes the need for remapping as buckets grows. That is,
    consistentHash(h, n) equals:

    *   n - 1, with approximate probability 1/n;

    *   consistentHash(h, n - 1), otherwise (probability 1 - 1/n).

SEE ALSO
