=head1 NAME

Digest::Guava - Perl XS interface to the Google's Guava consistent hashing algorithm

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Digest::Gauva qw(guava_hash);
  guava_hash($integer_key, $buckets_count);
  
OR

  use Digest::Gauva;
  Digest::Gauva::guava_hash($integer_key, $buckets_count);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Google's Guava hashing algorithm.

Assign to input a "bucket" in the range [0, buckets), in a uniform manner
that minimizes the need for remapping as buckets grows.
That is, consistentHash(h, n) equals:

=item * n - 1, with approximate probability 1/n;

=cut

=item * consistentHash(h, n - 1), otherwise (probability 1 - 1/n).
